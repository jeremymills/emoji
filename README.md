PHP Emoji class
===============
A handy class for using Emojis in your php project. Certain IDE's don't like emojis.
They are party poopers. But their editor is so good.

Now you can use Emojis in your code without your IDE crapping out on you.

Two ways to use it:

First use Emoji:

`use Webdevvie\Emoji\Emoji;`

now use the emoji class:
`Emoji::FLAG_FOR_NETHERLANDS` to get the Dutch flag ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±

or if you want to display it in a console use :
 `Emoji::CONSOLE_FLAG_FOR_NETHERLANDS` to get the Dutch flag with a space after it so it shows up properly in the console.

or maybe you are more of a Unicorn person ðŸ¦„:
`Emoji::UNICORN_FACE`


This is nothing special. Just a simple helper class.

There are no tests, there are no methods.
